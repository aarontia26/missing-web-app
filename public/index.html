                <p>When you believe a person in your life has disappeared, it's important to act quickly to set a search in motion. Start by calling the police department to file a missing persons report, then take measures to conduct your own search. If the person does not return home, you may need to alert the media and hire a private investigator. By taking the right steps quickly, you increase the chances of finding a missing person.</p>
